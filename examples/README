This directory contains all the example programs which are included in 
the PGI package.  The examples are organized by feature, with examples 
for each feature contained in a seperate subdirectory. 

Following is a list of the files in this directory:

  README             This file

  AutoPar            Directory containing auto parallelization examples

  CUDA-Fortran       Directory containing CUDA Fortran examples

  OpenACC            Directory containing OpenACC examples

  OpenMP             Directory containing OpenMP examples


 
To build and run the examples within one of these subdirectories using 
the 64-bit compilers for example, do the following:

% cd /my/work/dir
% cp -r $PGI/win64/2018/examples/AutoPar .
% cd AutoPar

Now build/run all the tests within the AutoPar subdirectory using the 
following command.

% make NTHREADS=4 all

To get further instructions about building/running the tests within one
of the subdirectories type "make" without any arguments.
